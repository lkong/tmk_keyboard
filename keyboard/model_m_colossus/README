===================================

Bare with me... I'm often scatterbrained. :P

This is all a bit messy and needs cleaning.  You'll likely encounter comments in the code that I forgot to modify and may be incorrect. Beware of dragons.

Also, I'm (clearly) still learning how to interact with github.

Eventually I'll write some useful documentation.

Eventually.
